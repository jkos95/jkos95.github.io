		My love, <br/><br/>
		
		&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I hope you like your ring! I know you said you wanted a flat ring, and I looked for hours trying to find one, and then I custom made one online... That's another story itself, but the one I found had the diamonds cut off at the bottom to allow a flat part at the top, this would restrict light into the diamond, and it wouldn't sparkle at all. This one I took a picture to a local jeweler and had him make from scratch, and it's the closest to flat I could find that looked nice. <br/><br/>
		
		&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I made sure it had 1 big stone in the middle, and 2 smaller ones on the side. Also, the band is yellow gold, the bezel is white gold (yellow gold would make the diamonds look yellow), and on the inside of the band lies an inscription "1 COR. 13:4". <br/><br/>
		
		&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I love you very much, and even though I know it's not exactly what you wanted, something jumped inside of me when I saw it, and I just knew it was the perfect ring. May every sparkle you see show you another reason why I love you. I hope you liked your scavenger hunt :) <br/><br/><br/>
